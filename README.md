# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The company we focus on during this analysis is Pewlett Hackard and the up-and-coming HR analyst we are going to assist is called Bobby. Pewlett Hackard is a company that has been in the market for a long period of time along with a great part of its employees. Due to this fact, a great part of its workforce will be retiring soon and the company will not only have a great number of positions to fill but a great database with employees' information to manage and update.  

Our duty in this analysis is to help the company and Bobby develop a new and clearer database that specifies which employees are retiring and if they are eligible for a retirement package, and how many and which positions the company will need to fill in the near future.

## Results
 
 During the process of this analysis, we created a couple of charts using SQL, PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to help us identify the answers to the major questions the company has. 
 
 Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
* From the first part of this analysis, we could gather the number of employees and their titles that were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955, which will be the first ones in retiring, and their time working for the company.
