# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The company we focus on during this analysis is Pewlett Hackard and the up-and-coming HR analyst we are going to assist is called Bobby. Pewlett Hackard is a company that has been in the market for a long period of time along with a great part of its employees. Due to this fact, a great part of its workforce will be retiring soon and the company will not only have a great number of positions to fill but a great database with employees' information to manage and update.  

Our duty in this analysis is to help the company and Bobby develop a new and clearer database that specifies which employees are retiring and if they are eligible for a retirement package, and how many and which positions the company will need to fill in the near future.

## Results
 
 During the process of this analysis, we created a couple of charts using SQL, PostgreSQL, and pgAdmin to help us identify the answers to the major questions the company has. 

* From the first part of this analysis, we could gather the number of employees and their titles that were born between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955, which will be the first ones in retiring, and their time working for the company. According to this chart, from the 300,024 total employees, 133,777 or 44.59% of them are most likely to leave or have already done, the company in the near future.

* Moreover, in this first part of the analysis we were also able to find out that the jobs positions or titles that are going to be needed the most due to the retirement of employees will be Senior Engineer and Senior Staff with a gap of 25,916 and 24,926 free positions respectively.

* Furthermore, in the second part of this project, we identified that from the total number of employees that are leaving the company, just 1,549 are eligible for the mentorship program that Pewlett Hackard is giving them due to their hard and long work history experience with them.
